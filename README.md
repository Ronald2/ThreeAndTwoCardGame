## Description

The Three and Two Card Game is a simple card game implemented in C# using object-oriented principles. The game is played by multiple players, and the objective is to collect a hand with three cards of the same rank (three-of-a-kind) and two cards of another rank (a pair). The first player to achieve this combination wins the game.

This repository contains the C# implementation of the Three and Two Card Game, including the classes for the card deck, player, board, and game logic. The project follows best practices of object-oriented design, encapsulation, and modularity.
